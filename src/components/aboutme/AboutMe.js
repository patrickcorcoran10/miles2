                <p> Iâ€™m a coding school student looking to use my new skills in web development and continue learning in
                    a professional setting.

                    I'm detail-oriented, organized, and determined with a passion for creating and problem-solving.

                    So far, I'm familiar with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Foundation, Node.js, Express.js, and SQL. I know I
                    still have so much to learn and I'm excited to keep exploring.
                </p>
